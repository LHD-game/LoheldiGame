- DO alter the 'Scale Factor' of the model.

To do this:

e.g. Easy DG Assets 1 - Wood + Stone | Models | Wood | Corner-Wood-Model-01.
- In the Inspector window, alter the 'Scale Factor' field. 
- Increase this value to increase the model size.
- Ensure ALL models match this scale to ensure uniformity.
